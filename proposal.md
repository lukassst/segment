**Project Title:** *Semantic Volumetrics: Foundation Models for the Longitudinal Digital Twin in Coronary Artery Disease*

**Principal Investigator (Target):** Prof. Marc Dewey  
**Institution:** Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Radiology  
**Funding Mechanism:** DFG Reinhart Koselleck-Projekt  
**Requested Duration:** 5 years  
**Estimated Budget:** €1.5-2.0M

## Executive Summary: Transforming Cardiovascular Care Through AI

**The Clinical Problem**: Manual coronary segmentation is a bottleneck preventing precision cardiovascular medicine:
- **Patients wait weeks** for core-lab analysis results (delays treatment decisions)
- **Costs €200-400 per case** (limits access to advanced imaging analysis)
- **Only available at specialized centers** (excludes rural/resource-limited hospitals)
- **Cannot scale to population-level screening** (millions of chest pain patients annually)

<<<<<<< HEAD
**The Human Impact**: 
- Delayed diagnosis → continued angina, preventable MACE
- High costs → rationing of advanced imaging analysis
- Limited access → health disparities between urban/rural populations
- Slow research → years to analyze trial data, delaying clinical translation
=======
**The Core Innovation:** Adapting Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 3D cardiovascular and oncological imaging, creating the first **multi-domain foundation model** trained on unprecedented scale: DISCHARGE (25M images), SCOT-HEART (10M images), and Prostate Trial (4M images).
>>>>>>> 3259bc51afe7eefab41a302d45af8337b4c42427

**Our Solution**: Browser-based AI segmentation platform where:
- **Clinicians click on coronary artery → AI segments it in 2 seconds** (vs. 30-60 minutes manual)
- **Works in any browser** (no software installation, accessible from clinic/home)
- **AI runs on hospital server** (data stays secure, GDPR compliant)
- **10x faster, €20-40 per case** (vs. €200-400 manual)

**Patient Benefits**:
- **Faster diagnosis**: Results same day (vs. weeks waiting for core-lab)
- **Better access**: Available at any hospital with CT scanner (not just specialized centers)
- **Lower costs**: €180-360 savings per patient → more patients can access advanced imaging
- **Earlier intervention**: Rapid plaque characterization → timely treatment → prevent MACE

**Healthcare System Benefits**:
- **€1.8-3.6 million annual savings** per hospital (1,000 cases/year)
- **Democratize advanced imaging**: Enable precision cardiology at community hospitals
- **Accelerate research**: Analyze trial data in months (vs. years) → faster clinical translation
- **Reduce health disparities**: Make expert-level analysis accessible to underserved populations

**The Innovation** (Reinhart Koselleck criteria):
- **Exceptionally innovative**: First browser-based foundation model platform for cardiovascular imaging
- **High risk**: Can SAM (trained on natural images) achieve clinical-grade accuracy on medical images?
- **High reward**: Transform cardiovascular care globally—from specialized centers to every hospital

**Technology**: TypeScript + Vite + Niivue (browser) + FastAPI + SAM-Med3D (hospital server)

## 1. Why Reinhart Koselleck?

### The "Exceptionally Innovative" Criterion
Traditional AI in radiology is **static**—focused on **detection** (finding lesions). We propose to build a model that understands the **evolution of disease**—moving from detection to **prediction** (understanding which lesions will cause events). This requires:
- Training on outcome data (MACE from DISCHARGE)—the model won't just see "a plaque"; it will see "a plaque that likely leads to an event"
- Longitudinal modeling (plaque progression over time)
- Foundation model adaptation (SAM → cardiovascular domain via plaque-aware adapter)
- Fine-tuning on existing high-quality ground truth masks to bridge the gap between "General SAM" and "Clinical-Grade SAM"

### The "High-Risk" Criterion
**Three Major Uncertainties:**

1. **Multi-Vendor Harmonization Challenge**
   - DISCHARGE/SCOT-HEART span Siemens, GE, Canon scanners
   - Contrast protocols vary significantly
   - **The Risk:** Can a single model achieve consistent plaque quantification that matches (and eventually exceeds) core-lab standards across this heterogeneity?

2. **Foundation Model Transferability**
   - SAM was trained on natural images (SA-1B dataset)
   - Medical imaging has fundamentally different statistics (low contrast, noise, motion artifacts)
   - **The Risk:** Can a Foundation Model be adapted to identify "vulnerable" plaque features (low-attenuation, positive remodeling) with the same reliability as a trained sub-specialist?

3. **Clinical Validation Gap**
   - Core-lab experts require years of training
   - **The Risk:** Can AI match their inter-observer agreement (κ~0.7-0.8) in identifying high-risk plaque?
   - Will radiologists trust AI for high-stakes decisions involving patient management?

## 2. Scientific Foundation

### 2.1 The Data Goldmine

#### DISCHARGE Trial (25M images)
- **Design:** Multicenter RCT comparing CCTA vs. invasive angiography
- **Scale:** ~3,500 patients, ~25 million image slices
- **Outcome Data:** 3.5-year MACE follow-up
- **Our Advantage:** Link plaque morphology → clinical events at unprecedented scale
- **Status:** Data access via Prof. Dewey (trial steering committee)

#### SCOT-HEART Trial (10M images)
- **Design:** CCTA vs. standard care for stable chest pain
- **Scale:** ~4,100 patients, ~10 million image slices
- **Outcome Data:** 5-year MACE, 10-year mortality
- **Our Advantage:** External validation, different population (UK vs. EU)
- **Status:** Collaboration established with University of Edinburgh

#### Prostate Trial (4M images)
- **Design:** Multi-parametric MRI for prostate cancer detection
- **Scale:** ~4 million image slices across multiple sequences (T2W, DWI, DCE)
- **Cross-Domain Impact:** Validates foundation model generalization beyond cardiovascular
- **Our Advantage:** Tests SAM adapter on different tissue types, contrast mechanisms
- **Status:** Data access negotiations in progress
- **Technical Validation:** Leverage existing MRI classification pipeline (boahK/MRI_Classifier)
  - Pre-trained models for multi-parametric body MRI series classification
  - Confusion matrix validation framework
  - Siemens/Philips multi-vendor training strategy (Strategy 2 approach)

#### Utilizing the Annotation Goldmine
- **Existing high-quality ground truth segmentations** from prior core-lab work (DISCHARGE + SCOT-HEART)
- Enables supervised fine-tuning of Mask SAM 3D adapter on domain-specific features
- Bridges the critical gap between "General SAM" (natural images) and "Clinical-Grade SAM" (medical imaging)
- Foundation for active learning loop: AI suggests → Human corrects → Model improves

### 2.2 Technical Innovation: Mask SAM 3D Architecture

**Dual-Stage Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: nnU-Net Prior**
- Generates coarse arterial skeleton
- Provides anatomical context (which vessel is which)
- Reduces search space for SAM

**Stage 2: SAM-3D Adapter ("Plaque-Aware Refinement")**
- Takes nnU-Net mask as semantic prompt
- Refines segmentation with plaque-specific attention mechanisms
- Outputs:
  - Vessel lumen boundary
  - Plaque composition (calcified, non-calcified, low-attenuation)
  - Remodeling index
  - Stenosis severity

**Why This Hybrid Matters:**
- **Standard nnU-Net limitation:** Misses subtle plaques due to low contrast
- **Pure SAM limitation:** Lacks cardiovascular anatomical priors
- **Our solution:** Hybrid approach where nnU-Net provides anatomical context and SAM-3D refines with plaque-specific intelligence
- **Critical advantage:** Can identify high-risk plaques that standard models miss

## 13. Conclusion: The Koselleck Vision

This proposal embodies the Reinhart Koselleck spirit:
- **Exceptional Innovation:** First foundation model for cardiovascular imaging
- **High Risk:** Uncertain if SAM transfers to medical domain
- **High Reward:** Transform cardiovascular risk assessment globally

We are not building another segmentation tool. We are building the **intelligence layer** through which the next decade of cardiovascular trials will be analyzed—moving from detection to prediction, from static snapshots to dynamic digital twins.

**The Question:** Can we teach a machine to see what cardiologists see—and predict what they cannot?

**The Answer:** With DISCHARGE, SCOT-HEART, and the Mask SAM 3D architecture, we have the data, the technology, and the team to find out.
